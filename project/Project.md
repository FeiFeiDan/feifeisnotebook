### Introduce to the Device Tree

The definition of device tree is clearly provided by Wikipedia.

> Devicetree is a datastructure describing the hardware components of a particular computer so that operating system's kernal can use and manage those components, including the CPU or CPUs, the memory, the buses and the integrated peripherals.

> Given a currect device tree, the same compiled kernal can support different hardware configuration within a wider architecture family.

Device tree is mandatory for ARM devices as a remedy for vast number of forks by move the significant part of hardware description out of the kernal binary. The hardware description move into the compiled device tree blob, which is handed to the kernal by boot loader.
