## Embedded Machine Vision

### Mini Project Requirements

* Use dataset: **BBD100K** to traing a yolo model.
  * **cannot use pre-trained models or complete repos**.
* Run the model on a real time camera stream.
* **Extra Credit:** People counting algorithm.

### Analysis

It seems that it's not hard as I expected, after I pull the code from Github, the only thing I need to do is to type one line command and wait for the training to be finished. Here is the command:

```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 300 --data your_dataset.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights ''
```
